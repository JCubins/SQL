The purpose of this project was to link and explore 11 interconnected tables of sales and information pertaining to a digital media store.

-- Show customers (full name, id, country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

-- Show only customers in Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Customerid, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

-- Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing coutnry.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.Invoiceid, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingAddress FROM customers cust
LEFT JOIN invoices inv ON cust.Customerid = inv.Customerid
WHERE cust.Country = "Brazil";

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title FROM employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT(BillingCountry) FROM invoices
ORDER BY BillingCountry;

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT inv.Invoiceid, emp.FirstName, emp.LastName FROM invoices inv
LEFT JOIN customers ON inv.Customerid = customers.Customerid 
LEFT JOIN employees emp ON customers.SupportRepId = emp.Employeeid
ORDER BY emp.LastName;

-- Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total, inv.invoiceid, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.FirstName AS SalesFirst, emp.LastName AS SalesLast FROM invoices inv
LEFT JOIN customers cust ON inv.Customerid = cust.Customerid 
LEFT JOIN employees emp ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.Employeeid
GROUP BY cust.FirstName, cust.LastName
ORDER BY inv.Total DESC;

-- How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(invoiceid) FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%";

-- What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE "2009%";

-- Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT inv.InvoiceID, tracks.Name FROM invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN tracks ON inv.Trackid = tracks.Trackid;

-- Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT inv.InvoiceID, tracks.Name, artists.Name AS Artist FROM invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN tracks ON inv.Trackid = tracks.Trackid
LEFT JOIN albums ON tracks.Albumid = albums.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN artists ON albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId;

-- Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre
SELECT tracks.Name , albums.Title, media.Name media, genres.Name genre FROM tracks
LEFT JOIN albums ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN media_types media ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media.MediaTypeID
LEFT JOIN genres ON tracks.GenreId = tracks.GenreId;
