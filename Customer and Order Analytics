# In this SQL example, I'm querying a database wtih multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT COUNT(acctnum) FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE order_id IN (SELECT orderID FROM BIT_DB.FebSales)
AND LENGTH(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each prodcut sold in January?
SELECT Product, ROUND(SUM(Quantity)*price, 2) AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at the 548 Lincoln St. Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February and what was the average amount spent for those cusomters?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) AS customers, ROUND(AVG(feb.Quantity*Price), 2) AS avg_cost FROM FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.Quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
